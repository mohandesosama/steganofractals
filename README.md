# Steganographic Fractals
The objective is to embedd a secure message into tree fractals.  
The secure message is in binary form "010100011000" and the carrier image is an image created with tree fractals algorithm  
the idea is to descritize angles and branch lengthes to go with the values of the secure message. For example obtuse angle can represent 1   
and acute angle represents 0. Each branch in the tree has two sub-branches, if the left branch is smaller than right branch this represents 0 otherwise it represents 1
